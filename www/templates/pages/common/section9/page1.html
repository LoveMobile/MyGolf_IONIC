				<h2>To give your students the opportunity to play a round of golf and a short golf course can be set up on an oval or even in a gymnasium or school hall. The following are some suggestions about how you can set this up.</h2>
				<h3>Teeing Area</h3>
				<p>Can be defined using a pair of witches hats, small buckets, cricket stumps or stakes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<h3>Greens/Holes</h3>
				<p>A hole can be constructed using a hula hoop or skipping rope. A stake with a flag or a witches hat can be placed in the middle to represent a flag stick. It the student’s ball finishes in the hoop or rope it is counted as in the hole.</p>
				<h3>Hazards/Obstructions</h3>
				<p>As students’ skill levels develop you can introduce hazards or obstacles. Items such as bins, chairs, trees, buildings, sports equipment etc. can be utilised, to increase the difficulty of getting to the hole.</p>

			<h2>THINGS TO CONSIDER</h2>
			<p><strong>Below are some points to consider when designing a school oval/gymnasium golf course.</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure holes follow each other in numerical sequence i.e. 1, 2, 3 etc. The following holes tee markers should be located close to the previous green.</li>
				<li>Depending on the area create 9 holes ranging from a distance of 20 - 50metres.</li>
				<li>Do not place holes close to roads, buildings or other hazardous objects.</li>
				<li>Holes running parallel to each other should not be too close together.</li>
				<li>In most circumstances one group of students should be playing the hole at any given time.</li>
				<li>Establish a safe swing area where students should stand when awaiting their turn.</li>
				<li>Each player can have their own ball, but only one club per group is recommended unless there are left handers in the group.</li>
