		<h1>PATHWAY</h1>
		<p>MyGolf is just the beginning for junior golfers with many options available to them upon completion of the school program. The following diagram shows the pathway available for junior golfers in Australia.</p>
		<p>A link to your local golf club or facility is critical to ensure your students have a clear pathway to continue their journey from the schoolyard to the golf course. </p>
		<p>Your State/Territory Association or Junior Foundation will be able to assist you in creating this link and will also provide you with the most relevant contact at your local club or facility. We would encourage you to invite this contact to one of your MyGolf Schools program sessions to provide information to the students about the pathways available if they wish to continue golf.</p>
