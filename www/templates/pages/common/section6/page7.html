			<h2>How To Play</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Break the group into 2 teams. </li>
				<li>They will stand in a line on either side of the playing area. </li>
				<li>Ensure participants have one cone each, that they will place anywhere in the playing area. </li>
				<li>One team will have their cones flipped up to look like a  tee, the other will have their cones flipped over to look like  a bunker. </li>
				<li>On the coaches call the two teams need to flip the other team’s cones so that they resemble the team they are on, eg. the tees need to make the cones into bunkers, the bunkers need to turn the cones into tees. </li>
				<li>Allow the flipping to go on for 1-2 minutes and stop the game to see which team has the most cones in their designated way.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Additions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>As children will become aware of ways to manipulate the rules, add different rules to avoid children not moving or staying on one cone. </li>
				<li>Make playing area larger or smaller depending on the level of movement.</li>
			</ul>
