			<h2>How To Play</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Break the group into 2 teams. </li>
				<li>They will stand in a line on either side of the playing area. </li>
				<li>Ensure participants have one cone each, that they will place anywhere in the playing area. </li>
				<li>One team will have their cones flipped up to look like a  tee, the other will have their cones flipped over to look like  a bunker. </li>
				<li>On the coaches call the two teams need to flip the other team’s cones so that they resemble the team they are on, eg. the tees need to make the cones into bunkers, the bunkers need to turn the cones into tees. </li>
				<li>Allow the flipping to go on for 1-2 minutes and stop the game to see which team has the most cones in their designated way.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Additions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Give all runners a ball - to free a stork, both stork and runner must successfully throw and catch the ball,  otherwise both become storks. </li>
				<li>Introduce tag-free islands or safe zones where players can go for a specified amount of time to escape the taggers - this concept accommodates children with varying mobility who may not be able to play for the entire duration of the game. </li>
				<li>Change the two handed throw to a bounce pass, one handed throw, or a non-preferred hand pass. </li>
				<li>Replace the stork with another position, e.g. sitting with legs tucked and off the ground.  This can also work in the reverse and an easier position than the stork can be used for younger players.</li>
