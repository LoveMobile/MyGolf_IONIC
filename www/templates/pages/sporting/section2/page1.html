		<h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE PROGRAM</h1>
		<h2>The MyGolf Sporting Schools resource manual has been developed to assist teachers and coaches in the delivery of the MyGolf Sporting Schools Program.</h2>
		<p>The objective of the program is to introduce golf to school children in a simple engaging program that teachers can easily deliver as part of their core curriculum requirements, even if they haven’t had experience playing golf.</p>
		<p>Each session will cover off on 2 of the 3 main skills in golf; Putting, Chipping and Full Swing.</p>
		<p>The final session gives children the chance to compete in a modified ‘golf game’, where students get the chance to construct their own golf course within the school environment.</p>
		<p>While there are recommended activities and games to deliver each session, there are also additional activities or suggested amendments that teachers can utilise should they need to adjust the skill level required for each games.</p>

		<h1>PHILOSOPHY</h1>
		<p>The MyGolf Sporting Schools Program has been designed to align itself with the current ACARA national curriculum and general educational philosophies to engage and retain students in sporting programs, while still providing a simple structure for teachers/deliverers to understand and implement. There are a number of focus areas of the program that are key to it being successful.</p>
		<h3>Fun</h3>
		<p>Above all, it’s imperative that any activity is fun and engaging for students to keep them involved and excited about the MyGolf Sporting Schools program.</p>
		<h3>Games</h3>
		<p>Using fun games that still include the basic skills and elements of the game of golf is the best method to ensure students of all abilities are involved and learning through actively participating. The MyGolf Sporting Schools program encourages learning through fun, team based, inclusive games and activities which allow for skill repetition and progression. </p>
		<h3>Simplicity</h3>
		<p>The essence of the program is for students to enjoy golf and develop the basic motor skills to play the game along the way. It’s important to ensure all games and the explanation and instruction is kept as simple and easy for students to understand throughout.</p>

		<h3>Repetition</h3>
		<p>Like in anything, the one way to learn a new skill is to continually practise it. The design of the MyGolf Sporting Schools program ensures students are able to perform a skill repeatedly throughout different or similar games. Teachers/Deliverers need to ensure that students are actively involved in all games as much as possible.</p>
