				<li>Break participants into pairs </li>
				<li>With one ball per pair, players pass the ball back and forth. </li>
				<li>Ball must change hands completely. </li>

				<li>Highlight successful passes and ask children to show their successful passes to the rest of the group. </li>
				<li>For smaller children, it may be easier to allow them to move their feet around when passing and receiving. </li>
