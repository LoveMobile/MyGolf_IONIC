		<h3>MyGolf National Junior Program</h3>
		<p>Golf Australia and the PGA of Australia signed an historic joint venture to increase junior participation in golf, resulting in both bodies endorsing and promoting MyGolf as the nationally recognised junior golf program.</p>
		<p>Run at clubs and facilities across Australia, MyGolf is a structured 10 week, three-tiered introductory program to the sport of golf for children. The MyGolf program aims to engage and develop boys and girls through fun, game-based learning activities, taking them from an introductory level and preparing them with the skills and knowledge to go out on-course.</p>
		<h3>MyGolf Curriculum</h3>
		<p>The MyGolf National Junior program has a fun and flexible curriculum that aligns with the school term. The recommended program length is 10 weeks, however the MyGolf program has the flexibility to be run over a shorter or longer period of time, or even consolidated into a School Holiday Program.</p>
		<h3>MyGolf Enrolment Fee</h3>
		<p>One of the major benefits of the new MyGolf program is the flexibility of the enrolment fee to suit the needs of the Centre, the Deliverer and/or PGA Professional. The Recommended Retail Price for a 10 week MyGolf program is $110 which includes a $7 fixed cost and a $20 optional cost for participants to cover a participant pack and State/Territory School Kit Rebate and Transaction Fee. All money above the fixed costs goes back to the facilitator or host venue.</p>
