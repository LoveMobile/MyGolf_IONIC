		<h2>As previously noted, there is only one swing in golf which can be shortened or lengthened or use different clubs to make the ball go different distances. The golf swing is made up of static and dynamic components.</h2>

			<h2>Grip</h2>
			<p>The grip is very important as it is the student’s only connection to the golf club, however it is more important that the student feels comfortable rather than technically perfect. </p>
			<p>Encourage students to connect their hands on the golf club. For right-handed students, their right hand should be below their left on the grip (vice versa for left handers). It’s fine if some younger students feel like separating their hands slightly to get greater control of the club – the important factor is that they are comfortable.</p>

			<h2>Aiming &amp; Alignment</h2>
			<p>Aim and alignment refers to aiming the club and aligning the body to give the best chance of hitting the ball at their desired target. To get the students to aim correctly, have them grip the club and place the club head behind the ball aiming directly at their target. With the club sitting behind the ball and pointed at the target, instruct students to stand side on while keeping the club still. Hopefully at this point their body and club are parallel to the target.</p>

		<h1>GOLF SEQUENCE (GASS)</h1>
		<p>Once students have their grip, aiming and alignment, it’s time to take stance and take a swing. </p>
		<p><strong>One simple acronym to remember the process of having a golf shot is GASS; Grip, Aim, Stance and Swing.</strong></p>
