			<h2>How To Play</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Establish a playing area with markers and ensure there are no obstructions. </li>
				<li>Place a hoop containing 15-20 golf balls inside the centre of the playing area. </li>
				<li>Split children into four teams - one in each corner of the playing area. </li>
				<li>When the coach starts the game, one player from each team runs to the hoop and collects a golf ball, which they roll back to the their team before running back and tagging the next player. </li>
				<li>Teams collect as many balls as possible in the allocated time, e.g. 60 seconds, or until all the balls have been removed from the hoop. </li>
				<li>The team who collects the most golf balls wins. </li>
				<li>Mobility restricted players can be stationed at home base and receive the returned golf balls.</li>
			</ul>

				<li>Introduce an activity before returning the ball to the team, e.g. jump on the spot five times.</li>
